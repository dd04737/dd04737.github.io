    <p>For this activity, I checked out how accurate IP address geolocation really is.  I used WhatIsMyIPAddress.com to find my IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, I then went to KeyCDN's geolocation tool to see where they were linked.  I learned that geolocation gives a rough idea of where an IP address is located, but it’s not super accurate.  Things like VPNs, proxies, or how ISPs route their connections can mess with the results.  Overall, it was interesting to see how IP addresses are tied to regions, but they don’t pinpoint exact locations like your home address.</p>
