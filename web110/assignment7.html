    <h1>Web Development Activities Summary</h1>

    <p><strong>Activity 1: HTML Structure and Tags</strong></p>
    <p>In this activity, I explored the basic structure of an HTML document, focusing on tags like html, head, body, and others.  I learned how essential these tags are in organizing a webpage and providing semantic meaning.  The activity emphasized the importance of properly structuring a document to ensure accessibility and proper display in browsers.  I now understand the significance of these tags in web development and how they contribute to creating well-structured websites.  In the future, I can apply this knowledge to create organized and efficient web pages that ensure optimal user experience and SEO benefits.</p>

    <p><strong>Activity 2: Creating and Styling a Web Page</strong></p>
    <p>The second activity was about creating a simple web page and adding styles using CSS.  I learned how to manipulate elements such as text, background colors, and borders to enhance the visual appeal of a webpage.  This activity was particularly useful in understanding the relationship between HTML structure and CSS design.  By applying CSS, I can now better manage the look and feel of a webpage, making it more engaging.  I plan to use these skills in future web projects, ensuring that my designs are responsive and visually appealing, which will improve user experience across various devices.</p>
