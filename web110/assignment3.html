    <p>For this assignment, I completed two activities related to search engines.  These activities helped me understand how search engines work and how to use them more effectively.</p>
    
    <p>The first activity I completed was about how search engines index and rank web pages.  I learned that search engines use web crawlers to scan and store information from websites.  They analyze factors like keywords, page relevance, and backlinks to determine rankings.  This activity helped me see why some websites appear at the top of search results while others do not.  I can apply this knowledge by using better keywords and structuring content properly if I ever need to create a website or improve search visibility.</p>
    
    <p>The second activity focused on advanced search techniques.  I explored different search operators like using quotation marks for exact phrases and the minus sign to exclude words.  I also learned how to filter results by date and site.  These techniques make searching more efficient and accurate.  I can use this in my studies to find reliable sources faster and in my future career to gather information more effectively.</p>
    
    <p>These activities improved my understanding of search engines and how to use them to find the best information online.  I plan to use these skills whenever I need to research something thoroughly.</p>
