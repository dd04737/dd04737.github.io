    <h1>Assignment 4 - Email Activities Summary</h1>

    <p><strong>Activity 1: Send, Receive, and Respond to Email</strong></p>
    <p>In this activity, I learned the basic functions of sending, receiving, and responding to emails.  This included composing a new message, adding recipients in the "To," "Cc," and "Bcc" fields, and formatting the email content properly.  I also practiced responding to emails, including replying to individual senders and replying to all recipients in a thread.  This activity helped me understand the importance of professional email etiquette and the correct structure of an effective email.</p>
    <p>Applying this knowledge will be beneficial in both my current academic environment and my future career.  Being able to communicate clearly and professionally via email is crucial in any professional setting.  I can now ensure my emails are well structured, concise, and appropriately addressed, which will help in both networking and formal communication.</p>

    <p><strong>Activity 2: View Email Message Headers</strong></p>
    <p>Through this activity, I explored how to view and interpret email message headers.  Email headers contain metadata such as the sender's IP address, the email's path through different servers, timestamps, and authentication details.  I learned how to access these headers in different email clients and how to read the information to trace the origin of an email and identify potential security issues like phishing or spoofing.</p>
    <p>This knowledge is especially valuable in IT and network administration roles, where email security is a priority.  I can apply these skills to analyze suspicious emails, verify the authenticity of messages, and enhance cybersecurity measures within an organization.  It will also help me troubleshoot email delivery issues by understanding the technical path an email takes from sender to recipient.</p>
