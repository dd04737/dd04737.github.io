        Activity: FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
        <br><br>
        For this activity, I explored the fundamentals of FTP (File Transfer Protocol) by reviewing tutorials and practicing with a demo server.  FTP is a protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server over a network.  I learned that FTP operates using two connections: a control connection for commands and a data connection for file transfers.  Additionally, secure versions like FTPS and SFTP encrypt the transfer process to enhance security.
        <br><br>
        Through this activity, I gained a better understanding of how FTP clients, like FileZilla, facilitate file transfers.  I practiced accessing an FTP server via a web browser and observed how files can be uploaded, downloaded, and organized.  This knowledge will be valuable for managing web development projects, especially when updating website content.
        <br><br>
        In the future, I can apply these FTP skills to maintain and deploy files for my personal projects, such as hosting pages through GitHub or other web services.  The ability to troubleshoot file transfer issues will also benefit me when setting up and maintaining servers in my IT career.
