    <h1>Networking Activities Summary</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Activity 1: Review IP Address Settings for Your Local Network</strong></p>
    <p>In this activity, I explored how to check and configure IP address settings on my local network.  I learned about different types of IP addresses, including static and dynamic IPs, and how they are assigned through DHCP.  Additionally, I practiced using the command prompt to verify my network settings using commands like <code>ipconfig</code> on Windows and <code>ifconfig</code> on Linux.  Understanding these concepts helps in troubleshooting network connectivity issues.  In the future, I can apply this knowledge when setting up or managing home and office networks, ensuring efficient IP allocation and troubleshooting network conflicts.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Activity 2: Research and Compare License and Support Costs for Windows, OS X, and Linux</strong></p>
    <p>For this activity, I compared the costs associated with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.  I discovered that Windows and macOS typically involve higher upfront and ongoing licensing costs, while Linux distributions like Ubuntu and Fedora are generally free with optional paid support.  Windows and macOS offer official technical support, while Linux relies heavily on community forums and paid enterprise support from companies like Red Hat and Canonical.  This research helps me make informed decisions when selecting an OS for personal or professional use.  In the future, I can use this knowledge to balance cost and support needs when setting up systems for work or home computing.</p>
