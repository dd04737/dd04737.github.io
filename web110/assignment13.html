    <h1>Final Project Planning - Gantt Chart</h1>

    <p>
        My final project is titled <strong>"How to Secure Your Home Network with pfSense and Pi-hole"</strong>.
        The objective of this project is to demonstrate how to effectively set up and manage a secure home network using pfSense as a firewall and Pi-hole as a network-wide ad and tracker blocker.
        This includes configuring pfSense for robust network security, setting up Pi-hole for DNS filtering, and integrating both for optimal performance.
        The project also focuses on documenting the setup process, testing network security, and creating a guide for replication.
        The scope includes researching best practices, installing and configuring software, testing the setup, and producing a video tutorial uploaded to YouTube.
        The end result will help others understand how to secure their home networks using pfSense and Pi-hole with clear, actionable steps.

    <p>
        While completing this assignment, I learned how critical it is to break down complex technical projects into manageable tasks using a Gantt chart.
        It helped me see how each phase of my final project, from researching pfSense and Pi-hole configurations to testing and documenting, requires careful time management.
        I also practiced organizing configuration files and visual assets for the tutorial, which reinforced skills I’ll use in network administration.
        Learning how to plan and visualize timelines in Excel adds another tool to my toolkit for future cybersecurity, networking, and tech projects.
        I’ll apply this method in future home lab setups, IT roles, or any tech-focused projects involving network security or system administration.
