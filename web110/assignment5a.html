    <h1>Assignment 5a: Social Media Activities</h1>

    <p><strong>Activity 1: Create a Social Media Account</strong><br>
    In this activity, I explored the process of creating a social media account, including setting up a profile, customizing settings, and understanding platform-specific features.  This exercise helped me better understand how social media platforms guide new users through onboarding and introduce their unique functionalities.  I learned about optimizing profile settings, adding security measures like two factor authentication, and choosing an appropriate username and profile picture.  In my current or future environment, this knowledge will help me establish and manage professional or personal online identities effectively.  Whether networking for career opportunities or engaging with an online community, understanding profile setup and platform specific tools will be beneficial.</p>

    <p><strong>Activity 2: Research Privacy Settings</strong><br>
    This activity focused on exploring privacy settings across different social media platforms.  I reviewed options such as restricting profile visibility, managing data sharing permissions, and adjusting security settings to prevent unauthorized access.  One key takeaway was the importance of regularly updating privacy settings to align with personal security preferences and staying aware of how platforms handle user data.  Applying this knowledge, I will ensure that my own social media accounts are secure, limiting exposure to potential risks like data breaches or identity theft.  In the future, I can also help others navigate privacy settings to enhance their online security.</p>
