    <h1>Final Project - How to Secure Your Home Network with pfSense and Pi-hole</h1>

    <p>
        My final project is titled <strong>"How to Secure Your Home Network with pfSense and Pi-hole"</strong>.
        The objective of this project is to demonstrate how to effectively set up and manage a secure home network using pfSense as a firewall and Pi-hole as a network-wide ad and tracker blocker.
        This includes configuring pfSense for robust network security, setting up Pi-hole for DNS filtering, and integrating both for optimal performance.
        The project also focuses on documenting the setup process, testing network security, and creating a guide for replication.
        The scope includes researching best practices, installing and configuring software, testing the setup, and producing a video tutorial uploaded to YouTube.
        The end result will help others understand how to secure their home networks using pfSense and Pi-hole with clear steps.

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout this semester in WEB110, I gained a strong understanding of how the Internet works and how to build and manage websites from scratch.
        I learned to use HTML and CSS to design responsive web pages, how to manage code using GitHub, and how to include multimedia content to enhance user engagement.
        This final project brought all those skills together by integrating networking, security, multimedia production, and web publishing.
        I now feel more confident in my ability to both secure a home network and present technical content through a website.
